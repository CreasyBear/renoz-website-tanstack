# Enterprise Product Context: RENOZ Energy Website

## Mission & Market Position

**RENOZ Energy is Western Australia's premier battery energy storage OEM**, designing and engineering lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery systems specifically for Australian conditions. We bridge the gap between global manufacturing capabilities and local market needs, delivering enterprise-grade energy storage solutions with genuine Perth-based expertise.

## Core Business Problem Solved

**The Solar Economics Paradox:** Homeowners generate solar during the day but pay premium rates to buy electricity back at night. RENOZ provides the storage solution that makes solar economics work.

### **Economic Reality Addressed:**
- **Day Generation:** Export solar for 5¢/kWh (feed-in tariff)
- **Night Consumption:** Buy grid electricity for 25-45¢/kWh (peak rates)

- **Result:** 80-90% reduction in electricity costs for solar households

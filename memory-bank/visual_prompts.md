## 📏 Technical Requirements

- **Aspect Ratio:**
  - Full Width Hero: `--ar 16:9` or `--ar 21:9` (Cinematic)
  - Feature Cards/Grid: `--ar 3:2` or `--ar 4:3`
  - Vertical/Mobile: `--ar 9:16`
- **Style Parameters (MidJourney v6+):**
  - `--style raw`: Reduces "AI artistic interpretation" for a more photographic look.
  - `--stylize 100-200`: Adds polish without getting too fantasy-like.
  - **Negative Prompts:** `--no text, watermark, people faces, neon, cyberpunk, cluttered` (unless requested).

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Hero Scenes:** Ask for "wide shot" or "cinematic" to ensure negative space for text overlays.
2. **Color Grading:** If images are too saturated, request "muted tones" or "desaturated" in the prompt.
3. **People:** Avoid photorealistic faces. Use silhouettes, backs of heads, or hands only.
4. **WA Identity:** Reference "Perth," "Western Australia," "Wheatbelt," "Pilbara" to ground the images in a specific place.
5. **Storytelling:** Every image should answer the question: "What does energy independence *look* like?"

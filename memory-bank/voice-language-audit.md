# Ultrathink Analysis: RENOZ Website Voice & Language Consistency Audit

## 1. Implicit Expectations Surfaced

### Stated Requirements

- Create a professional, trustworthy website for RENOZ Energy (battery OEM)
- Position as Perth's local battery manufacturer
- Target residential, rural, and commercial customers
- Emphasize Australian engineering and local support

### Unstated Expectations

- **Authentic Local Voice**: Customers should feel they're dealing with genuine Perth locals who understand WA conditions, not corporate marketing speak
- **Technical Credibility**: Complex battery technology explained in accessible terms without dumbing down
- **Relationship-Building**: FAQ focuses on long-term support relationships, not just product features
- **Economic Pragmatism**: Emphasis on real financial benefits (storing at 30c vs selling at 5c)
- **OEM Differentiation**: Clear positioning as manufacturer/partner, not just another reseller

### Implicit Benchmarks

- **Local Hardware Stores**: Trustworthy, knowledgeable, no-nonsense advice
- **WA Farmers/Contractors**: Practical, reliable, backs their work
- **Mining/Engineering Companies**: Technical competence with local understanding

### Frustrations to Escape

- **Overseas Manufacturers**: Generic marketing, poor local support, don't understand Australian conditions
- **Big Solar Companies**: Corporate feel, pushy sales, focus on commissions over relationships
- **Imported Batteries**: "Military grade" hype vs real Australian engineering

## 2. Delta Definition

### "Meets" Expectations

- Professional website with product information
- Basic company details and contact forms
- Standard battery product descriptions
- Generic Australian energy market language

### "Exceeds" Expectations

- **Authentic Perth Voice**: Reads like a local engineer explaining batteries over a coffee
- **WA-Specific Credibility**: Every claim grounded in Australian conditions (heat, dust, isolation)
- **Relationship-First FAQ**: Questions focus on support partnerships, not just technical specs
- **Economic Transparency**: Real numbers (30c storage vs 5c feed-in) vs marketing fluff
- **OEM Clarity**: "We build batteries for installers who build relationships with customers"

### The Gap Analysis (Based on Core Route Analysis)

| Current State | Target State | Status |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Residential**: "Genuine Security" ✅ | Already implemented | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **Rural**: "True Energy Independence" ✅ | Already implemented | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **Commercial**: "Total Control" ⚠️ | Currently "Turn Energy into a Managed Asset" | 🔄 NEEDS UPDATE |
| **About**: OEM positioning ✅ | "Perth's Battery OEM", technical credibility | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **FAQ**: Relationship focus ✅ | "We back our partners so they can back you" | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **Home**: Economic messaging ✅ | "30c storage vs 5c feed-in" | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| "Industry-leading" claims | Specific Australian condition benefits | Generic marketing language |

### World-Class Benchmark

**Local Perth Engineering Firms**: Clear communication, technical competence, relationship focus, genuine local pride.

## 3. Tangible Decomposition

### Characteristics Required

1. **Authentic Local Voice**: Language feels like Perth locals explaining complex tech simply
